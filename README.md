# Laskulator
This is a Simple calculator. It is a Java-based desktop app. 
It employs methods from the model class - Operation, which object was instantiated in the Laskulator Class.

The sign is set using the setSign method and it only happens when an operant is pressed. 
The getSign is then used to obtain the sign. Because the 
equalOps method has a String as a parameter, I passed the sign in there since the sign is a String. 
I used a switch to determine which sign had been entered. The sign entered calls the corresponding
method.
